# Gamma Manager - Simplified + Hotkeys (scuffed)

Simpler UI with keybinds function (only normal characters / some special characters like "-" "=" "[" etc.)

Save a Profile to define a "keybind" for the current settings, that will generate a .ini in the folder of the application (if not, try restarting the app), that .ini holds the keybinds
The Keybinds work while the app is hidden and on top of other apps.
